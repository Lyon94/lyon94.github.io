# Slack Card

### Slack is a popular chat platform.

A Slack channel usually shows a list of names and their messages. If you click on someone's name, you'll see a card pop up that looks something like the one on the link below.

<!-- My work flow process -->
After following the preliminary instructions from slack, I forked the project on github and cloned it to my local machine.

I read through the README file to understand the instructions and then set off to work after taking a look at the initial project set up and final project set up pictures. This is to facilitate give me a picture of what to do to get the expected final project look.

I created a container div in the HTML file and then adjusted the top and left margin to enable me a good view of what I'm doing.

I changed and added what needed to be added as regards the instructions from the README. Since there was not much javascript code needed for the project at the moment, I added the Javascript code in the body tag before the closing body tag. 

Finally, I made a push to github and then github page to enable others have a look at the project.
