            <p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, is a module of CSS that defines a CSS box model
              optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension. It was also designed as a
              method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment
              capabilities.</p>
            <p> When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with
              layout
              in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the
              two-dimensional
              model of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout">CSS Grid Layout</a>,
              which controls columns and rows together.</p>
            <p><strong>Simply put; CSS Flexbox is a set of css properties that enables the creation of one dimensional
                layout. </strong></p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>The flex container</strong>
                <p>This is the containing element that which contains items that are meant to be structured within the
                  layout. An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex
                  container, we set the value of the area's container's display property to flex or inline-flex. As
                  soon as
                  we do this the direct children of that container become <strong>flex items</strong>. The flex items
                  are
                  the elements containered within the flex container. Look at this like a mother to children
                  relationship;
                  The flex container is the mother while the flex items are the children.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>The flex direction</strong>
                <p>The flex-direction is simply the arrangements of the flex items within the flex container along the
                  horizontal or vertical plane. The flex direction has four values that can be used for arrangement of
                  the
                  flex items; row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse. Assuming a direction starting from the left;
                  the
                  row value represents the horizontal axis oriented from the left to the right, and row-reverse from
                  the
                  right to the left. Similar principle applies to the column and column-reverse values.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>The flex wrap</strong>
                <p>The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto
                  multiple
                  lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction that lines are stacked. The acceptable values
                  for
                  flex wrap are; wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse.</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> <em>nowrap</em>:
                      The flex items are laid out in a single line which may cause the flex container to overflow. This
                      is
                      the default value.</li>
                    <li><em>wrap</em>:
                      The flex items break into multiple lines.</li>
                    <li><em>wrap-reverse</em>:
                      Behaves the same as wrap, however the flex items are arranged in reverse order.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>The flex flow</strong>
                <p>The flex-flow CSS property is a shorthand property for flex-direction and flex-wrap properties. It
                  is
                  pertinent to start with the direction value followed by the wrap value. Some examples of its values
                  are;
                  row wrap, row-reverse nowrap, column-reverse wrap-reverse, etc.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Order</strong>
                <p>The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. Items in a
                  container are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order. Note that negative
                  values are allowed.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>The flex</strong>
                <p>To have more control over flex items, we can target them directly using the "flex" property. It is a
                  shorthand way of expressing three properties that are used in controlling the ratios of distribution
                  of
                  the available space among flex items on the main axis:
                  <ul>
                    <li>flex-grow</li>
                    <li>flex-shrink</li>
                    <li>flex-basis</li>
                  </ul> The flex shorthand allows you to set the three values in this order — flex-grow, flex-shrink,
                  flex-basis.</p>
                <p>There are shorthand values for flex;
                  <ul>
                    <li>flex: initial. Setting flex: initial resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox. This is
                      the
                      same as flex: 0 1 auto. </li>
                    <li>flex: auto. Using flex: auto is the same as using flex: 1 1 auto; everything is as with
                      flex:initial but in this case the items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if
                      required.</li>
                    <li>flex: none. Using flex: none will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you wrote
                      flex: 0
                      0 auto. The items cannot grow or shrink but will be laid out using flexbox with a flex-basis of
                      auto.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The shorthand you often see in tutorials is flex: 1 or flex: 2 and so on. This is as if you used
                  flex: 1
                  1 0. The items can grow and shrink from a flex-basis of 0.

                              .box {
                                display: flex;
                              }

                              }

          <header>Flexbox Axes</header>
          <article>
            <p>The arrangement of flex items within the container works on the principle of its axes. There are two
              axes in
              css flexbox; <em>the main axis and the cross axis.</em> The main axis is the principal direction of the
              flex
              items while the cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>The main axis</strong>: The main axis is defined by flex-direction. If row or row-reverse is
                used,
                the
                main axis will run along the row in the inline direction. If column or column-reverse is used, the main
                axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction. The arrangement of items
                along the main axis can be achieved using the justify-content property. Its acceptable values are
                flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly.
              </li>
              <li><strong>The cross axis</strong>: The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if the
                flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the column and vice
                versa.
                The arrangement of items along the cross axis can be achieved using the align-items property. Its
                acceptable values are flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch and baseline.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="images">
              <img src="images/row.png" alt="row direction"> <img src="images/column.png" alt="column direction">
            </div>
            Understanding which axis is which is important when we start to look at aligning and justifying flex items;
            flexbox features properties that align and justify content along one axis or the other.

          <header>Flexbox Usage</header>
          <article>
            <p>Why use flexbox?? In a perfect world of browser support, the reason you'd choose to use flexbox is
              because
              you want to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another. As you lay out your items you want
              to
              control the dimensions of the items in that one dimension, or control the spacing between items. These
              are
              the uses that flexbox was designed for. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigation: Alignment of items within the navigation bar is easier done with flexbox. A typical
                example;
                After listing the flex items within the flex container, align the horizontally using the
                justify-content
                and align-items values.
                <pre><code>
                    nav ul {
                      display: flex;
                      justify-content: space-between;
                    }
                 </code></pre>
                <p>If I wanted all of my navigation items to have equal width, then I might use flex: auto, which is
                  the
                  shorthand for flex: 1 1 auto — all items grow and shrink from a flex-basis of auto. This would mean
                  that
                  the longer item would have more space.</p>
                <pre><code>
                          nav ul {
                            display: flex;
                          }
                          
                          nav li {
                            flex: auto ;
                          }              
                      </code></pre>

              </li>
              <li>Centering Items: In the past, alignment of items vertically used to be a tedious task, it has been
                made
                straightforward using the alignment properties in flexbox, as the following example shows.
                <pre><code>
                            .box {
                              display: flex;
                              align-items: center;
                              justify-content: center;
                            }
                            
                            .box div {
                              width: 100px;
                              height: 100px;
                            }
                        </code></pre>
              </li>
              <li>Card layout pushing footer down: Whether you use flexbox or CSS Grid to lay out a list of card
                components, these layout methods only work on direct children of the flex or grid component. This means
                that if you have variable amounts of content, the card will stretch to the height of the grid area or
                flex
                container. Any content inside uses regular block layout, meaning that on a card with less content the
                footer will rise up to the bottom of the content rather than stick to the bottom of the card. Flexbox
                can
                solve this. We make the card a flex container, with flex-direction: column. We then set the content
                area to
                flex: 1, which is the shorthand for flex: 1 1 0 — the item can grow and shrink from a flex basis of 0.
                As
                this is the only item that can grow, it takes up all available space in the flex container and pushes
                the
                footer to the bottom. If you remove the flex property from the live example you will see how the footer
                then moves up to sit directly under the content.
                <pre><code>
              
                .card {
                  display: flex;
                  flex-direction: column;
              }
              
              .card .content {
                  flex: 1 1 auto;
              }

          <article>
            <p>Browser support for flexbox is excellent, and the majority of browsers do not need a prefix at this
              point.
              Safari was the last of the major browsers to remove prefixes, with the release of Safari 9 in 2015. The
              two
              browsers you should still keep in mind for cross-browser compatibility are:
              <ul>
                <li>Internet Explorer 10, which implemented the display: flexbox version of the specification with the
                  -ms-
                  prefix.</li>
                <li>UC Browser, which still supports the 2009 display: box version only with the -webkit- prefix.</li>
              </ul>Note also that Internet Explorer 11 supports the modern display: flex specification however it has a
              number of bugs in the implementation.
